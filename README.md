Originally a bold idea I had regarding the 3n+1 / collatz conjecture. 

At first, it was able to prove that a certain percentage (with increasingly more optimizations all the way up to >99.8%) of all natural numbers can't be the "pivot" of a counterexample.

Later, with the basis of the existing tools, it also discovered a continous linear "beam" - proving that >55% of all natural numbers eventually reach 1.

Combining both, it becomes clear that there can't be a pivot of a counterexample and therefore the conjecture should be proven :)
